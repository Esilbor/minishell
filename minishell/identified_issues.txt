IDENTITFIED ISSUES 

- issue with multiple heredoc getting in a "waiting cat" state
. heredocs must be deleted at the end of the program 
- handle signals
- return values
- unclosed fd
- hide ?=0
- protect every malloc and ft_strdup
- leaks
- norm

would be nice to have it done:

- 2>b should redirect stderr to the file b (not done by most)
- update SHLVL (clearly optional if we want to flex)
- a no candy mode that cancel out colour display and get the prompt minimal $> 
- have the nested shell prompt to display SHLVL with 
                                                    *Candy_$hell> == SHLVL=3
                                                    **Candy_$hell> == SHLVL=4
                                                    ***Candy_$hell> == SHLVL=5
                                                    ****Candy_$hell> == SHLVL=6


the waiting cat state:

Candy_$hell> cat <<poi <<plo
heredoc> this is poi
heredoc> poi
heredoc> this is plo
heredoc> plo
plo
plo
Candy_$hell> cat
plo
plo
