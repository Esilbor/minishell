IDENTITFIED ISSUES

- builtin cd is wrong (done by mate2)
        must update PWD and OLDPWD

- handle signals
- heredocs must be deleted at the end of the program

- export test="ls -l"
- export test2="ls          -l  -a" (might not be compulsory)

- return values
- protect every ft_strdup
- check if no unclosed fd
- norm





****************************************************

would be nice to have it done:

- 2>b should redirect stderr to the file b (not done by most)
- update SHLVL (clearly optional if we want to flex)
- a no candy mode that cancel out colour display and get the prompt minimal $>
- have the nested shell prompt to display SHLVL with
                                                    *Candy_$hell> == SHLVL=3
                                                    **Candy_$hell> == SHLVL=4
                                                    ***Candy_$hell> == SHLVL=5
                                                    ****Candy_$hell> == SHLVL=6
Candy_$hell> /bin/ls gdsdfgsd
/bin/ls: cannot access 'gdsdfgsd': No such file or directory
Candy_$hell> echo $?
0
Candy_$hell>

>> return value must be 2



Candy_$hell> env | grep PWD ne fonctionne pas

cd ne rammene pas a home
