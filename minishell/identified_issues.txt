would be nice to have it done:

- 2>b should redirect stderr to the file b (not done by most)
- update SHLVL (clearly optional if we want to flex)
- a no candy mode that cancel out colour display and get the prompt minimal $>
- have the nested shell prompt to display SHLVL with
                                                    *Candy_$hell> == SHLVL=3
                                                    **Candy_$hell> == SHLVL=4
                                                    ***Candy_$hell> == SHLVL=5
                                                    ****Candy_$hell> == SHLVL=6
